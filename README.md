JumPy - a jumping icytower-ish game made in Pygame.

How high can you get? You think it's that simple? There are collapsing, vertically/horizontally moving and bounce platforms, falling deadly missiles and the game is getting faster and faster with time! 

- Keys:
LEFT/RIGHT ARROW - move left/right
SPACE - jump
ESC - pause

- ENJOY !!!
