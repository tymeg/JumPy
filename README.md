JumPy - a jumping icytower-ish game made in Pygame.

How high can you get? You think it's that simple? There are collapsing, vertically/horizontally moving and bounce platforms, falling deadly missiles and the game is getting faster and faster!

Keys:  
LEFT/RIGHT ARROW - move left/right  
SPACE - jump  
ESC - pause
